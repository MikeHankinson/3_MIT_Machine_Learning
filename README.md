## Projects 
- Project 1: Predict house prices in the Boston metropolitan area based on the features of the property and its locality using regression techniques.
- Project 2: Predict hotel booking cancellations based on reservation details and formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

### Skills and Tools
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, kNN 


### 1. Predict House Prices

#### Problem Statement
Predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us. In the process, identify the most important features in the dataset. Employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for us.

### 2. Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

#### Context
A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.

The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers' booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.

#### Problem Statement
The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal, they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
